# Earthquakes
Pull data sets containing details about earthquakes into a program, search through the data, 
and filter the data based on desired criteria. 
In this project, I have learned to 
(1) write programs that include multiple classes and ArrayLists of class types, 
(2) find the maximum value in an ArrayList, 
(3) use a Filter interface to search through data, 
(4) implement interfaces with method signatures, and 
(5) combine several filters together.
